# Crop Classification Using ResNet18
## Overview
This project implements a crop classification model using ResNet18, a pre-trained convolutional neural network. The model is fine-tuned on a custom dataset of crop images, enabling it to classify crops into 30 distinct categories.

## Dataset
Dataset was taken from Kaggle


## Model
The project uses ResNet18 from PyTorch's torchvision library, fine-tuned for the crop dataset.

## Results
Training Accuracy: 98.39%
Validation Accuracy: 56.97%
Testing Accuracy: 53.29%
